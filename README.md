 # Advanced Fisheries Economics Workshop (under development for April 2020 workshop)

Links to materials can be found here along with further instructions.

## Preparation

We will be using Jupyter notebooks and Python. 

The first-step is to click on the link at right and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

Download and install the Python 3.7 version. You will need administrator rights on your computer to do this.

Also have a look at [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (you will need a gmail account to access this).

## Philosophy

The approach we take is informed by a number of ideas, the first is that the practice of economics is largely a form of computation, the second it that analyses should be reproducible (reproducible research) and the third that when reporting the results ofanalysis, the emphasis should be on the written word rather than the computation (literate programming). Finally, the approach should be participative in the tradion of R.L. Moore's approach to teaching mathematics.

## Background

I recommend Preston McAfee, Tracy Lewis and Don Dale's [Introduction to economic analysis](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/dale/ieav21.) as background reading on general economics. Chapter 7 section 6 is on fisheries.

## References 

Arne Eide's [Introduction to Fisheries Economics](https://figshare.com/articles/Introduction_to_Fisheries_Economics/3784821#)
is a good reference. It uses Wolfram Language (Mathematica) for the exercises which is an alternative but less on-line support and help available. So we will use Python instead.

The material covered will draw on a variety of sources inlcuding the following books and papers that will be referred to during the workshop.

## Exercises

Exercise 1:
----------

[Markdown Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) We will do this as a warm-up exercise. Estimated Time 10 minutes.

Exercise 2:
----------

In Jupyter (anaconda version) using Markdown (insert a Markdown cell) write a brief bio of yourself and what you expect to achieve from the workshop. Estimated time 10 minutes.

Excercise 3:
-----------

Let's try some calculations:

- enter 1 + 1
- Run the cell
- Insert a new cell by clicking on the plus
- Enter  x = 1 + 1
- Enter x 
- Run the cell
- Insert a new cell
- Enter x + 1
- Run the cell
- Insert a markdown cell and describe what you did using markdown

Exercise 4:
----------
