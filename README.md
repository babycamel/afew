 # Advanced Fisheries Economics Workshop (under development for April 2020 workshop)

Links to materials can be found here along with further instructions.

## Preparation

We will be using Jupyter notebooks and Python. 

The first-step is to click on the link at right and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

Download and install the Python 3.7 version. You will need administrator rights on your computer to do this.

Also have a look at [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (you will need a gmail account to access this).


## Background

I recommend Preston McAfee, Tracy Lewis and Don Dale's [Introduction to economic analysis](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/dale/ieav21.) as background reading on general economics. Chapter 7 section 6 is on fisheries.

## References 

Arne Eide's [Introduction to Fisheries Economics](https://figshare.com/articles/Introduction_to_Fisheries_Economics/3784821#)
is a good reference. It uses Wolfram Language (Mathematica) for the exercises which is an alternative but less on-line support and help available. So we will use Python instead.

The material covered will draw on a variety of sources inlcuding the following books and papers that will be referred to during the workshop.
