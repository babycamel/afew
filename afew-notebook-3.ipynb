    "All forms of capital are more or less substitutes for one another; no regard has to be given to the composition of the stock of capital. Weak sustainability allows for the depletion or degradation of natural resources, so long as such depletion is offset by increases in the stocks of other forms of capital (for example, by investing royalties from depleting mineral reserves in factories).\n",

    "- strong sustainability: \n",
    "\n",
    "All forms of capital must be maintained intact independent of one another. The implicit assumption is that different forms of capital are mainly complementary; that is, all forms are generally necessary for any form to be of value. Produced capital used in harvesting and processing timber, for example, is of no value in the absence of stocks of timber to harvest. Only by maintaining both natural and produced capital stocks intact can non-declining income be assured.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already looked at the first two. The last two are introduced because some fish stocks have skewed surplus production functions. Particularly, equation 4. was developed in the context of Tuna stock assessments (although it ws earlier used in forestry where it is referred to as a Chapman-Richards equation and it was used even earlier in fluid dynamics where it is referred to as a Bernoulli equation after the Swiss mathematician and Philosopher who also invented the first epidemiological model).\n",

    "The exercise is to plot a number of curves. First plot a strate line for the TAC equation $ TAC = \\alpha X$ and then plot each of the four equations on the same graph. At the point of intersection $F(X_{SS}) = TAC(X_{SS})$ the stock is in steady state $X_{SS}$.\n",
